# Student Credentials DApp

## Vision

The **Student Credentials DApp** aims to provide a decentralized, secure, and transparent platform for managing and verifying student credentials on the Ethereum blockchain. By leveraging blockchain technology, we ensure that student records are immutable and accessible only by authorized individuals, enhancing trust and reducing the risk of fraud.

### Description

1. **Student Interface**: The interface through which students interact with the DApp to add and retrieve their credentials.
2. **Student Contract**: The smart contract deployed on the Ethereum blockchain that manages the student data.
3. **Ethereum Network**: The decentralized network where the contract is deployed and transactions are verified.

## Smart Contract Details

- **Contract Name**: `StudentCredentials`
- **Contract Address**: `<Your Deployed Contract Address Here>` *(Replace this with the actual address after deployment)*

### Key Functions

- **`addStudent`**: Allows a student to store their credentials.
- **`getStudent`**: Retrieves the stored credentials of a student using their Ethereum address.

## Future Scope

1. **Integration with Educational Institutions**: Collaborate with universities and educational platforms to allow for automatic credential verification.
2. **Multi-Signature Verification**: Implement multi-signature functionality where credentials need to be verified by multiple authorities before being stored.
3. **Data Encryption**: Add encryption to further secure student data on-chain.
4. **Cross-Chain Compatibility**: Extend the DApp to work with other blockchain networks beyond Ethereum.
5. **Mobile App Integration**: Develop a mobile application for easier access and management of credentials on the go.
